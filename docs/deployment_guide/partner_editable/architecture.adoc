=== AWS Managed Microsoft AD

The Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS*
* In the public subnets:

* Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets*
* A Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets*

* In the private subnets:

* An AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain*
* FSx for Windows File Server

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#

=== Self-managed Active Directory
